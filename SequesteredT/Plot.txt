Plot in a nutshell: Phoenix defends Pierre in a Homicide case over {something}, and gets him acquitted. 
Later, he gets invited to his home. Small Talk + Painting; Pierre goes to get a drink, and he's poisoned. Phoenix is alerted
to the sound of the glass cracking (which is actually used to obscure the time of death [string]), and goes in to find a half-conscious Larry Butz
and the victim's body on the ground; the cracked wine glass, next to him. Phoenix has no choice but to alert the police, even if he believes he
is innocent of Pierre's murder; as he still was inside the house for wrong reasons.
